# Plant Health Monitoring System

This repository contains code for an IoT solution that monitors the health of plants using sensors. The system is built on a Raspberry Pi Zero W, which acts as the embedded computer, and utilizes one or more sensors connected via I2C communication. The collected data is processed and uploaded to the internet for further analysis and visualization. The project is developed as part of a coursework assignment.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to create an IoT product that monitors plant health by utilizing sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi Zero W. The Raspberry Pi acts as the central processing unit and communicates with the sensors via the I2C bus. The collected sensor data is processed and then uploaded to the internet for analysis and visualization.

## Features
- Monitor plant health using various sensors.
- Collect sensor data through the I2C interface.
- Process sensor data for analysis and event detection.
- Upload processed data to an MQTT broker for further processing.
- Implement server-side functionality for data presentation and analysis.
- User-friendly interface for interacting with the system.
